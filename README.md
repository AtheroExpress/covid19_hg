This repository includes an analysis, and some visualisations of the [COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://www.covid19hg.org) meta-analysis [results](https://www.covid19hg.org/results/). 

After each round, updated results and summary statistic downloads are available from the (still small but growing!) COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Analyses this time include severity, susceptibility and COVID-19 associated symptoms.
